Info:
This project was made as part of university class named Informatica Electr√≥nica 
in University Nacional de Rosario UNR.

We needed to read from several sensors on a microprocessing board, and needed to
send that over a serial port. I went a bit further and made and application 
that's able to chart the sensors in "realtime".

The format for the sensors is: <identifier>;<data><newline> where data is in the
units you want to display.

The program will automatic create a new chart for each new identifier.

Usage:
run setup.py to install it (python setup.py install)
